OVERVIEW:
The cougar (Puma concolor) (/ˈkuːɡər/, KOO-gər), also called puma, mountain lion, catamount, and panther, is a large small cat native to the Americas. It inhabits North, Central, and South America, making it the most widely distributed wild, terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere and one of the most widespread in the world. Its range spans Yukon, British Columbia, and Alberta in Canada; the Rocky Mountains; and areas in the western United States. Further south, its range extends through Mexico to the Amazon rainforest and the southern Andes Mountains in Patagonia. It is an adaptable generalist species, occurring in most American habitat types. It prefers habitats with dense underbrush and rocky areas for stalking but also lives in open areas.

LIFESPAN:
8-13 years

MAX SPEED:
72 km/h

MASS/WEIGHT:
63 kg

FUN FACTS:
Cougars are known by 40 different names in English alone. The most popular names for cougars are mountain lions, pumas, or panthers.
Often, they hide their kill in the same spot, hiding it by covering it with sticks and leaves.

Physical Characteristics

The head of the cougar is round, and the ears are erect. Its powerful forequarters, neck, and jaw serve to grasp and hold large prey. It has four retractile claws on its hind paws and five on its forepaws, of which one is a dewclaw. The larger front feet and claws are adaptations for clutching prey.

The cougar is slender and agile. It is the fourth largest cat species; adults stand about 60 to 90 cm (24 to 35 in) tall at the shoulders. Adult males are around 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in) long from nose to tail tip, and females average 2.05 m (6 ft 9 in), with overall ranges between 1.50 and 2.75 m (4 ft 11 in to 9 ft 0 in) nose to tail suggested for the species in general. Of this length, the tail typically accounts for 63 to 95 cm (25 to 37 in). Males generally weigh 53 to 72 kg (117 to 159 lb). Females typically weigh between 34 and 48 kg (75 and 106 lb). Cougar size is smallest close to the equator and larger towards the poles.

Conservation

The cougar is listed on CITES Appendix II. Hunting it is prohibited in Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, French Guiana, Suriname, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, and most of Argentina. Hunting is regulated in Canada, Mexico, Peru, and the United States. Establishing wildlife corridors and protecting sufficient range areas are critical for the sustainability of cougar populations. Research simulations showed that it faces a low extinction risk in areas larger than 2,200 km² (850 sq mi). Between one and four new individuals entering a population per decade markedly increases persistence, thus highlighting the importance of habitat corridors.
